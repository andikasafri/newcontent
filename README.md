Your project has successfully implemented all the required features. The code structure is well-organized, follows best practices, and demonstrates a good understanding of Next.js and React concepts.

---

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/components`**: Reusable UI components.
- **`src/pages`**: Components for application routes (e.g., Home, Cart, Login).
- **`src/lib`**: API functions and utility methods.
- **`src/store`**: State management logic using Zustand.
- **`src/types`**: TypeScript type definitions.
- **`src/hooks`**: Custom React hooks.
- **`src/styles`**: Global styles.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **API**: Fetch API for HTTP requests
